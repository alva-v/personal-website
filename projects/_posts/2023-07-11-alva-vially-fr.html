<p>The website you are currently browsing.</p>
<p>I made it using the
  <a href="jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static website generator</a>. It would have been absurd to query a database on every request for a simple website like this, a static site generator seemed like the right choice and I had wanted to try Jekyll for a long time. It has been pretty pleasant to work with and I might use it for a future project, even though I'd also like to try
  <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>
  For the CSS part, I wanted a simple and non-bloated look and took inspiration from the
  <a href="https://brutalist-web.design/">Brutalist web design guidelines</a>. Working up from raw HTML I gradually added minimal black and white styling.
</p>
<p>Finally, because I share my email on my
  <a href="/contact">contact page</a>
  I had to make it unreadable for most scrapper bots. It's not written in the HTML document, instead, I use very simple Javascript (4 lines) to insert an encoded version of my email in the DOM.</p>

title: I'll be attending FOSDEM 2024
---

<p>
  <a href="https://fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> is a european FOSS event happening
  every year in Brussels, this year edition being on the weekend of the
  3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> of February. I'll be doing some volunteer
  work there.
</p>
<p>
  The event is kinda corporate and sponsored by Google, Cisco, Huawei etc... If
  you're looking for an anticapitalist alternative, know that
  <a href="https://offdem.net/">OFFDEM</a> is happening at the same time. I plan
  on spending at least half a day there.
